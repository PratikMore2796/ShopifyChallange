Challanges:
The only thing i faced problem while creating this application is to remove the old image and insert new image in folder. It was
difficult but I enjoyed and I had done the task successfully. The application is developed within 1 day.
I was also confuse what should I put on Home page i.e. index.php page because there was no data available. One this is for sure
if I got more time then I can compelete this application by adding more functionalities such as search and everything.

Thank You
